This is a text file that has some extra whitespace at the start and end. Whitespace is a catch-all term for spaces, tabs, newlines, and a bunch of other things that computers distinguish but to us all look like spaces, tabs and newlines.


The Python method called "strip" only catches whitespace at the start and end of a string. But it won't catch it in       the middle,		for example,

in this sentence.		Once again, regular expressions will

help		us    with this.
