D-Lab helps Berkeley faculty, staff, and students move forward with world-class research in data intensive social science. We think of data as an expansive category, one that is constantly changing as the research frontier moves. We offer a venue for methodological exchange from all corners of campus and across its bounds. 

D-Lab provides cross-disciplinary resources for in-depth consulting and advising access to staff support and training and provisioning for software and other infrastructure needs. Networking with other Berkeley centers and facilities and with our departments and schools, we offer our services to researchers across the disciplines and underwrite the breadth of excellence of Berkeleyâ€™s graduate programs and faculty research. D-Lab builds networks that Berkeley researchers can connect with users of social science data in the off-campus world.
