    "In this session, we're going to discuss *topic modeling*. In topic modeling, we aim to discover how the documents in a corpus may be modeled as a function of specific topics. This is not the same thing as direct clustering, though, in which we might directly assign each document to a particular cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider genre classification. Some books may neatly fall into one genre, such as mystery, science fiction, etc. However, other books may be considered as incorporating multiple genres. You might have a fantasy novel which has mystery components to it, or a romance novel set in the future. In these cases, we don't want to cluster the fantasy novel into a \"fantasy\" bucket, and the romance novel in a \"romance\" bucket. We'd instead like to have some measure of assigning various topics, with different magnitudes to documents. This is the goal of topic modeling.\n",

    "## Non-negative Matrix Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be used to perform topic modeling. It was first [introduced](https://www.nature.com/articles/44565) by Lee and Seung in 1999.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does *non-negative matrix factorization* mean? Non-negative implies we're not working with any negative numbers, and matrix factorization implies we're taking a matrix, and breaking it down into \"factors\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix under consideration is going to be some numerical representation of the text. We've already considered one - the document term matrix! Specifically, we're going to build a TF-IDF matrix from the data - let's call this matrix $V$. Let's remind ourselves what $V$ is: it's a $D\\times T$ matrix, where $D$ is the number of documents, and $T$ is the number or terms, or tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "![NMF](../images/nmf.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in NMF is to write this matrix as a product of two matrices,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V \\approx WH\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W$ is a $D\\times K$ matrix and $H$ is a $K\\times T$ matrix. So, in matrix $W$, we can still consider rows as corresponding to documents, and in $H$, we can think of columns as corresponding to terms. But what about $K$, the inner dimension?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of $K$ as enumerating *topics*. If $K$ corresponds to topics, then each row of $H$ corresponds to a different topic. We can interpret $H$ as enumerating what contribution each *term* makes to each *topic*. For example, if the first row of the NMF only has non-zero entries for terms `soccer`, `basketball`, and `baseball`, we might reasonably conclude that the topic corresponds to \"sports\". The numbers for each entry indicate the contribution of that term to the topic - so if the topic is mainly baseball, it might have a higher value in that entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean for $W$? It's detailing how each *document* (rows) break down into *topics* (columns). So, we can think of NMF as estimating the contribution different topics to a specific document. In newsgroups, we might expect there to be a large contribution from that \"sports\" topic above into the samples labeled as \"rec.sports.baseball\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The breakdown of the original matrix into $W$ and $H$ can only be interpreted if there are no negative entries in any matrix. We already know a TF-IDF DTM is going to be non-negative. If we guarantee that $W$ and $H$ are as well, we can quite literally think of this factorization is creating building blocks for each document!\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a small issue here: we can get the breakdown of documents into topics, but it's up to us to \"interpret\" what the topics might be. This can be tricky business, as we might see. Furthermore, we don't even know how many topics we should pick! There are procedures to identify a good number of topics, but at some level it is subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try fitting an NMF to the newsgroups data. First, we need to use `TfidfVectorizer` to transform the data into a document term matrix (remember how to do this?)."

    "## Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a Bayesian model that captures how specific topics can generate documents. It was [introduced](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v3/blei03a.htmlhttps://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v3/blei03a.html) in machine learning by Blei et al. It is one of the oldest models applied to perform topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "One significant difference between LDA and NMF is that LDA is a *generative* model. This means that it can be used to *generate* new documents, by sampling from it. Assume we have a number of topics $T$. Then, we generate a new document as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a number of words $N$ according to a Poisson distribution. If you're not familiar with a Poisson distribution, don't worry - the only thing you need to know is that the outputs from a Poisson distribution can only be nonnegative integers (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3 ...).\n",
    "2. Choose a vector of values $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_T)$ from a Dirichlet distribution. The details of a Dirichlet distribution aren't too important other than that it guarantees all of the $\\theta_i$ add up to 1, and are positive. So, we can think of the $\\theta_i$ as proportions, or probabilities.\n",
    "3. For each of the $N$ words $w_n$:\n",
    "- Choose a topic $t_n$ according to a Multinomial distribution following $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. In other words, choose a topic according to the probabilities set by $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ (remember, we're thinking of these values as proportions, or probabilities).\n",
    "- Choose a word $w_n$ from a probability distribution $p(w_n|t_n)$ conditioned on $t_n$. This probability distribution is another Multinomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA does not model the order of the words, so in the end, it produces a collection of words - just like the bag of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "![lda](../images/lda.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot of variables there, so let's consider a concrete example. Let's suppose we have two topics: soccer and basketball. These are $t_1$ and $t_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some topics are more likely to contains words than others. For example, soccer is more likely to contain `liverpool` and `freekick`, but probably not `nba`. Basketball meanwhile will very likely contain `rebound` and `nba`. Furthermore, even though it's unlikely, a soccer topic might still refer to the `nba`. This unlikeliness is captured through the probabilities assigned in the distribution $p(w_n|t_n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, each document might consist of multiple \"proportions\" of topics. We've already seen this in NMF, only this time, LDA captures this via a probability distribution rather than a matrix operation. So, Document 1 might mainly be about Soccer, and not really reference basketball - this would be reflected in the probabilities $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=(0.9, 0.1)$. Meanwhile, another document might equally reference soccer and basketball, so we'd need a different set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=(0.5, 0.5)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, we're going to use `scikit-learn` to perform LDA. This time, however, we'll use a `CountVectorizer`, since LDA explicitly models *counts*."
