Text naturally is represented as words, which are understandable to humans because we have a grammatical and syntactical structure we use to extract meaning from those words. However, most machine learning and data science techniques utilize numerical methods to extract patterns from large datasets. So, we need to find a way to convert the language into a numerical representation. We'll start with this goal in mind, and demonstrate how involved this process can be.\n",
